Some help to get you started on your SASS journey, not only using the syntax but utilising the full power of SASS with functions, maps, loops, checks etc.

## Questions
If you do have any questions about my code or would like some help knowing how you can achieve something in SASS, feel free to e-mail me at jackoconnor21@hotmail.co.uk

I will add to these files gradually as and when I need to create solutions to simplify my styling workflow during my own project development processes.
